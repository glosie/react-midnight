## CHANGELOG
### 0.6.0
API has been abstracted into a `Dately` component to allow custom calendars to be built.

Bower package is now exported as `ReactDately`

Changed weird API for disabling dates. Now use the prop `disabledRules` to apply a rule that will be treated as disabled with all events removed.

### <0.5.3
I'm lazy and forgot to add changes. Will do someday, maybe.
